Topological Sort:
Linear ordering of verticies such that if there is an edge b/w u and v, u appears before v in that ordering

Only applicable in case of directed acyclic graph

1. In case graph not directed not possible because:
Then if an edge b/w 1----2
1 should come before 2
2 should come before 1
Not possible

2. Incase graph cyclic not possible because:
1 ---> 2 ---> 3 ---> 1

1 comes before 2
2 comes before 3
3 comes before 1 
Cyclic depdency so not possible
